# Playwright DOM Extractor Implementation Status

## Core Components Status

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| DOM Monitor | ✅ Active | Extracts DOM elements and generates semantic keys |
| Semantic Helper | ✅ Active | Provides natural language element selection |
| Natural Language Selectors | ✅ Active | Matches descriptions to elements with scoring system |
| Legacy Selectors | ⚠️ Deprecated | Backward compatibility maintained for old functions |

## Primary API Functions

| Function | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `getElementByDescription` | ✅ Recommended | Gets selector string from natural language description |
| `getByDescription` | ✅ Recommended | Gets Playwright locator from natural language description |
| `getSemanticSelector` | ⚠️ Deprecated | Legacy function, use `getElementByDescription` instead |
| `getSelfHealingLocator` | ⚠️ Deprecated | Legacy function, use `getByDescription` instead |
| `updateSelectorForKey` | ⚠️ Deprecated | Legacy function, no longer needed |

## Documentation Status

All documentation files have been updated to focus on the natural language approach:

- README.md
- SEMANTIC-KEYS.md
- SMART-SELECTOR.md (now focused on natural language)
- MCP-INTEGRATION.md
- BEST-PRACTICES.md

## Example Files

All example files have been updated to use the new natural language functions:

- essential-demo.spec.ts
- self-healing-demo.spec.ts
- show-natural-language-selector-demo.ts (renamed from smart-selector)
- test-ts-natural-language-selector.ts (renamed from smart-selector)

## Migration Guide

1. Replace `getSemanticSelector` with `getElementByDescription`
2. Replace `getSelfHealingLocator` with `getByDescription`
3. Remove calls to `updateSelectorForKey` as they are no longer needed
4. Update your imports to include the new functions

## Future Enhancements

1. TypeScript type generation for semantic keys and alternative names
2. Improved alternative names generation with AI
3. Enhanced integration with Cursor AI for better element analysis
